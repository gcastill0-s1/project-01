## Overview

This repository is intended to serve as a learning resource for practitioners looking to explore various sample projects. Each project folder contains all the necessary files, including source code, configuration files, and documentation, to get started quickly.

## Projects

### 1. Sample Configurations

The **Sample Configurations** project provides various configuration file templates that can be used to set up different environments or applications. These templates include configurations for web servers, databases, and other services.

- **Directory**: `project-nn/case-nn/`
- **Key Features**:
  - Configurations for different environments (development, staging, production).
  - Examples for various services like Nginx, Apache, MySQL, etc.
  - Easy-to-modify templates for custom setups.

- **Files**:
  - `README.md`: Documentation on how to use and customize the configuration files.
  - `nginx.conf`: Sample configuration file for a web server.

### 2. Code Examples

The **Code Examples** project contains various Python scripts that demonstrate different programming concepts, algorithms, and libraries. These examples are designed to be educational and cover a wide range of topics.

- **Directory**: `project-nn/case-nn/`
- **Key Features**:
  - Simple and clear scripts to illustrate different concepts.
  - Examples include data processing, API integration, file handling, and more.
  - Well-documented code with inline comments for easy understanding.

- **Files**:
  - `tscript-nn`: Sample script to configure in your environment. These are mostly written in Javascript, Python, or Java.

### 3. Event Generator

The **Event Generator** project demonstrates how to create synthetic events based on predefined samples. This project is useful for simulating event data for testing, development, or demonstration purposes.

- **Directory**: `project-nn/event-gen/`
- **Key Features**:
  - Generate random events based on sample templates.
  - Support for various output formats (e.g., console, file, network).
  - Configurable event frequency and output size.
  - Asynchronous event generation with adjustable time ranges.

- **Files**:
  - `event_generator.py`: Main script for generating events.
  - `config.json`: Sample configuration file for defining event generation parameters.
  - `README.md`: Documentation for setting up and running the event generator.
